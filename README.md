## Introduction

This is a project given to me by CodePath. Throughout this project, I was able to:
- Understand the Splunk interface
- Build and run basic searches in Splunk
- Create Splunk dashboards, reports, and other visualizations
- Analyze a cybersecurity dataset and identify potential security incidents
- Create incidents in Catalyst 
- Input and analyze observables (IoCs) for each incident based on provided incident response documents
- Create tasks for documenting the incident timeline and summarizing key findings
- Manage incident response workflows in Catalyst
